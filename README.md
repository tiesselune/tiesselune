# 👋 Hi, I’m @tiesselune

👨‍🏫 I'm a computer science teacher and game developer, based in France;

👨‍💻 I mostly work on Web stuff and games, but I enjoy getting my hands dirty in low-level shenanigans every once in a while, and automating most of the tasks I don't want to spend time on.

I'm working on 🦀 Rust stuff and utilities including a toy 3D engine, `wtvr3d`, as well as Javascript & TypeScript webcomponents, and use Unity 3D 🧊 on the daily.

Don't hesitate to reach out here on my public 💌 address!
